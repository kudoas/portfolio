# Repository-specific instructions for GitHub Copilot

## Overview
This repository has strict rules for changes and reviews.
When reviewing pull requests, you must follow the constraints defined in AGENTS.md
even if they are not automatically applied.

If any rule is unclear, do not guess. Ask for clarification.

## PR Review Rules (Important)
When reviewing a pull request:

- Always assume AGENTS.md constraints apply
- Do NOT suggest changes that violate AGENTS.md
- If a change touches a restricted area, explicitly point it out
- Prefer warning comments over proposing fixes for forbidden changes

If AGENTS.md is present but not visible in context:
- Mention that the review is based on assumed AGENTS.md rules
- Highlight potential violations conservatively

## Change Restrictions (Summary)
The following types of changes are typically restricted:

- Database schema changes
- Infrastructure or deployment configuration
- Dependency upgrades without explicit request
- Refactors that are not directly related to the PR purpose

If a PR includes any of the above, flag it clearly in the review.

## Review Focus
Prioritize the following when reviewing:

- Scope creep (changes unrelated to the PR goal)
- Breaking changes
- Missing or insufficient tests
- Assumptions introduced without evidence
- Maintainability and readability

Do NOT:
- Suggest large refactors unless explicitly requested
- Assume future requirements
- Optimize prematurely

## Tone
- Be concise and direct
- Avoid speculative language
- State risks clearly

## If unsure
When unsure whether something is allowed:
- Do not propose a fix
- Ask a question instead
